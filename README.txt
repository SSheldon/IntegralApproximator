Before installing this program, run "DLLReg.bat" as an administrator. This will register the MTParserCOM DLL so that the program can run it.

Once the MTParserCOM DLL has been registered, the program can be run by executing "Integral Approximator.exe".

Thanks, and I hope my program is useful for you!
